Booking Request Issue
=====================


DAC-RUH (Riyadh King Khaled) (US Bangla Airlines) - 5th Sept, 13:55 [Oneway, No Transit]

ei flight ta Booking Request aschilo

Reason:
-------
The segment was returned UC (unable to confirm), so Sabre halted the workflow.

Possible Reason to send UC:
---------------------------
Often pulls cached or slightly delayed inventory snapshots from ATPCO/airline availability feeds.
airline can choose to display a booking class (U, for example) in availability but set it to “closed for sale”
Airlines may control inventory with married segments (e.g., DAC–RUH alone is closed, but DAC–RUH–JED through-connect is open).
Especially in LCCs or smaller carriers (like Biman Bangladesh “BS”), their inventory sync with Sabre can lag.

Solution comes with Problem:
----------------------------
If i remove UC from HaltOnStatus List, the flight will be booked but You still can’t ticket. UC has no inventory; most ticketing/ET flow will block, and any autopricing you store can go stale before you fix the segment. Someone must rebook/reprice, try another RBD/flight, or contact the airline. Until then the PNR is effectively unusable. If UC is caused by married-segment logic, the segment will never auto-flip to HK; you must re-shop with the correct married pair/journey like DAC–RUH–JED.



2. Sylhet(ZYL)-London Heathrow(LON) (Biman Bangladesh) - 10th Sept, 09:35 [Oneway, No Transit]
